GAME CRASH FIXES - QUICK REFERENCE
===================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Game would crash if services became unavailable
- Now automatically falls back to local AI
- Game always completes

WHAT TO DO:
1. Run START_SERVICES.bat (or run: python service_controller.py)
2. Open index.html in browser
3. Click "New Game"
4. Play normally - works with or without services!

KEY CHANGES:
✅ Graceful offline mode - game continues if API fails
✅ Smart health checks - no aggressive retries
✅ Silent failures - no error message spam
✅ Better timeouts - 2 seconds instead of 5
✅ Robust ending - games always complete and save

IF SERVICES CRASH:
- Game automatically switches to local AI
- You won't see error messages
- Game continues normally
- You can finish and save

IF SERVICES WON'T START:
- Game still works - uses local AI
- Just click "New Game" and play
- Everything functions normally

TESTING:
Test 1: Start with services - should use neural network
Test 2: Kill services mid-game - game should continue with local AI
Test 3: Play without services - should work completely offline
